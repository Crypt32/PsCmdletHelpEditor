# PsCmdletHelpEditor
PowerShell Cmdlet Help Editor is the tool that helps you to create and edit XML-based help files for your PowerShell modules and PSSnap-Ins. This project is intended to replace existing project (since it is no longer developed and has breaking issues) created by Microsoft: [Cmdlet Help Editor](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/cmdlet-help-editor-tool/). I tried to resolve main issues with the existing editor, but failed.

This means that new editor is not a rewrited version of a previous tool, instead, PS Cmdlet Help Editor is written from scratch and uses brand new codebase.

Since I'm going to support this project (really??), you may expect bug fixes (if any) and new feature addition (if I have a time to implement them). Also, in the  Source Code tab you can explore and download project sources and rewrite as necessary. Editor usage is described in the Documentation tab.

Key features:
* Create new help project
* Import existing help from MAML files and from existing comment-based help
* Edit multiple modules at a time
* Edit and review help content in an easy and convenient way
* Use BB-codes for HTML rendering
* MAML, HTML and Markdown source preview and rendered HTML (for HTML and Markdown sources)
* Export into MAML XML and Markdown
* Publish help online via MetaWeblog API

System requirements:
- PowerShell 3.0;
- .NET Framework 4.7.2
